MPTHRIZZLE
==========

A simple native HTML5 mp3 player.

mpthrizzle exists to allow simple streaming of music from a web server (running wsgi and xsendfile) to any HTML5+mp3 capable device.

Reduce clutter and data duplication. Eat up your bandwidth cap. Enjoy music dead simply.

Coming later: ogg/flac support, users, bells&whistles


Requires 
========
A way to serve python: mod_wsgi/NgxWSGIModule or FastCGI
for apache: mod_xsendfile: https://tn123.org/mod_xsendfile/
for nginx: X-Accel-Redirect (more complicated setup)


Apache configuration
====================
For any directories that contain music files which _are not_ below the DocumentRoot of the server/vhost, you must add an explicit <Directory> block as such:

<Directory /path/to/musack>
    XSendFile on
    XSendFilePath /path/to/musack
</Directory>

Restart apache and that music will be available
